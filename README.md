# Home Movie Database

My family has never had cable, but we do watch and own a lot of movies. We have so many, in fact, that we sometimes forget what we have, and where they are located. This project seeks to remedy that issue by simply cataloging the movies that we have, and where we keep them. Along the way information is added from the Open Movie Database, just for fun.
